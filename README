4 Tiny Notes (GriddyTest) is a simple Android note taking app. The main
activity shows 4 small windows where the user can load or edit a note, and
clear the current window.

I made this simple app to start getting back to Android programming seriously,
starting with re-familiarizing myself with basic concepts, as well as exploring
fragments for the first time.

This app is incomplete; it is useable but still needs lots of work.
